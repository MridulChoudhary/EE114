Hey guys!
Since many of y'all have been asking for this, I'm putting it up here
EE114 Qns last year (and very likely this year for y'all too):
- B-H char (graph) of some random material given, calculate I, L, Î¼ etc
- Electric Vehicle ka Qn (DC machine, char of F_drag and Torque given)
- Derivation of starting torque, induced torque etc for per-phase equivalent of IM
- Power, losses and efficiency calculations, lots of focus on IM 
- Losses in all sorts of motors
- Torque-speed characteristics (v. imp)

Theoretical Qns (as far as I remember)
- Wattmeter methods
- Skin effect pe something
- Tappings in Transformer windings
- ELCB concept
(These were discussed in class by sir, so anything like that can appear in paper without a doubt)

All the best!! :)
